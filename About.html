      <p> My Name is Alona and I am 11 years Old this year. I was born in 2012 30th of January which is in the Summer. 2 of my other family friends have the same birthday date and month but one is in 2013 and the other in in 2011. I love colouring, painting, drawing and doing Art. When I grow up I want to be a photographer, actor or and artist. I am a very kind, organised and an active person, I want everything to be neat and tidy plus I love neat handwriting, I am a kind and genourous person that helps others. I am a active person who is tiny but fast at running.My dream place to go to is Paris, I want to take pictures at the Eiffel tower and eat lots of food made from paris like this specail dish with snails, buguettes, criossonts and macarons. </p>
